This feature works as follows: Once the current backup iscomplete, 4D deletes the oldest archive if it is found in the samelocation as the archive being backed up and has the same name (youcan request that the oldest archive be deleted before the backup inorder to save space). If, for example, the number of sets is set to3, the first three backups create the archives MyBase-0001,MyBase-0002, and MyBase-0003 respectively. During the fourthbackup, the archive MyBase-0004 is created and MyBase-0001 isdeleted. By default, the mechanism for deleting sets is enabled and4D keeps 3 backup sets. To disable the mechanism, simply deselectthe option.</span></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>This parameter concerns both application and log filebackups.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><span><strong>Backup only if the data file has beenmodified</strong>: When this option is checked, 4D starts scheduledbackups only if data has been added, changed or deleted since thelast backup. Otherwise, the scheduled backup is cancelled and putoff until the next scheduled backup. No error is generated; howeverthe backup journal notes that the backup has been postponed. Thisoption also allows saving machine time for the backup ofapplications principally used for viewing purposes. Please notethat enabling this option does not take any modifications made tothe project files or attached files into account.</span></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>This parameter concerns both application and log filebackups.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span><strong>Delete oldest backup file before/afterbackup</strong>: This option is only used if the "Keep only thelast X backup files" option is checked. It specifies whether 4Dshould start by deleting the oldest archive before starting thebackup (<strong>before</strong> option) or whether the deletionshould take place once the backup is completed(<strong>after</strong> option). In order for this mechanism towork, the oldest archive must not have been renamed ormoved.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>If backup fails</strong>: This option allowssetting the mechanism used to handle failed backups (backupimpossible). When a backup cannot be performed, 4D lets you carryout a new attempt.</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Retry at the next scheduled date andtime</strong>: This option only makes sense when working withscheduled automatic backups. It amounts to cancelling the failedbackup. An error is generated.</span></li><li><span><strong>Retry after X second(s), minute(s) orhour(s)</strong>: When this option is checked, a new backup attemptis executed after the wait period. This mechanism allowsanticipating certain circumstances that may block the backup. Youcan set a wait period in seconds, minutes or hours using thecorresponding menu. If the new attempt also fails, an error isgenerated and the failure is noted in the status area of the lastbackup and in the backup journal file.</span></li><li><span><strong>Cancel the operation after X attempts</strong>:This parameter is used to set the maximum number of failed backupattempts. If the backup has not been carried out successfully afterthe maximum number of attempts set has been reached, it iscancelled and the error 1401 is generated ("The maximum number ofbackup attempts has been reached; automatic backup is temporarilydisabled"). In this case, no new automatic backup will be attemptedas long as the application has not been restarted, or a manualbackup has been carried out successfully. This parameter is usefulin order to avoid a case where an extended problem (requiring humanintervention) that prevented a backup from being carried out wouldhave led to the application repeatedly attempting the backup to thedetriment of its overall performance. By default, this parameter isnot checked.</span></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>4D considers a backup as failed if the application was notlaunched at the time when the scheduled automatic backup was set tobe carried out.</span></p></blockquote><h3><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="settings.html_archive"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link"href="#settings.html_archive"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16"width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Archive</span></h3><p><span>These options apply to main backup files and to log backupfiles.</span></p><ul><li><p><span><strong>Segment Size (Mb)</strong> 4D allows you tosegment archives, i.e., to cut it up into smaller sizes. Thisbehavior allows, for example, the storing of a backup on severaldifferent disks (DVDs, usb devices, etc.). During restore, 4D willautomatically merge the segments. Each segment is calledMyApplication[xxxx-yyyy].4BK, where xxxx is the backup number andyyyy is the segment number. For example, the three segments of theMyApplication backup are called MyApplication[0006-0001].4BK,MyApplication[0006-0002].4BK and MyApplication[0006-0003].4BK. The<strong>Segment Size</strong> menu is a combo box that allows youto set the size in MB for each segment of the backup.

The archive files take up the least amount ofspace possible on the disk, but the backup is noticeableslowed.</span></li></ul></li><li><p><span><strong>Interlacing Rate and Redundancy Rate</strong> 4Dgenerates archives using specific algorithms that are based onoptimization (interlacing) and security (redundancy) mechanisms.You can set these mechanisms according to your needs. The menus forthese options contain rates of <strong>Low</strong>,<strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>High</strong> and<strong>None</strong> (default).</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Interlacing Rate</strong>: Interlacing consistsof storing data in non-adjacent sectors in order to limit risks inthe case of sector damage. The higher the rate, the higher thesecurity; however, data processing will use morememory.</span></li><li><span><strong>Redundancy Rate</strong>: Redundancy allowssecuring data present in a file by repeating the same informationseveral times. The higher the redundancy rate, the better the filesecurity; however, storage will be slower and the file size willincrease accordingly.</span></li></ul></li></ul><h3><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="settings.html_automatic-restore"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#settings.html_automatic-restore"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16"width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Automatic Restore</span></h3><ul><li><p><span><strong>Restore last backup if database isdamaged</strong>: When this option is checked, the programautomatically starts the restore of the data file of the last validbackup of the application, if an anomaly is detected (corruptedfile, for example) during application launch.
