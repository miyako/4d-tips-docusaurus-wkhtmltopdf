It is a form of communication used toexpress ideas, inform, and instruct. Like a spoken language, 4D hasits own vocabulary, grammar, and syntax; you use it to tell 4D howto manage your application and data.</span></p><p><span>You do not need to know everything in the language inorder to work effectively with 4D. In order to speak, you do notneed to know the entire English language; in fact, you can have asmall vocabulary and still be quite eloquent. The 4D language ismuch the same—you only need to know a small part of the language tobecome productive, and you can learn the rest as the needarises.</span></p><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="about.html_why-use-a-language"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#about.html_why-use-a-language"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Why use a Language?</span></h2><p><span>At first it may seem that there is little need for aprogramming language in 4D. In the Design environment, 4D providesflexible tools that require no programming to perform a widevariety of data management tasks. Fundamental tasks, such as dataentry, queries, sorting, and reporting are handled with ease. Infact, many extra capabilities are available, such as datavalidation, data entry aids, graphing, and labelgeneration.</span></p><p><span>Then why do we need a 4D language? Here are some of itsuses:</span></p><ul><li><span>Automate repetitive tasks: These tasks include datamodification, generation of complex reports, and unattendedcompletion of long series of operations.</span></li><li><span>Control the user interface: You can manage windows andmenus, and control forms and interface objects.</span></li><li><span>Perform sophisticated data management: These tasksinclude transaction processing, complex data validation, multi-usermanagement, sets, and named selection operations.</span></li><li><span>Control the computer: You can control serial portcommunications, document management, and errormanagement.</span></li><li><span>Create applications: You can create easy-to-use,customized applications that run stand-alone.</span></li><li><span>Add functionality to the built-in 4D Web server: buildand update dynamic web pages filled with your data.</span></li></ul><p><span>The language lets you take complete control over thedesign and operation of your application. 4D provides powerful“generic” editors, but the language lets you customize yourapplication to whatever degree you require.</span></p><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="about.html_taking-control-of-your-data"></a><a aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link" href="#about.html_taking-control-of-your-data"><svg aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Taking Control of Your Data</span></h2><p><span>The 4D language lets you take complete control of yourdata in a powerful and elegant manner. The language is easy enoughfor a beginner, and sophisticated enough for an experiencedapplication developer. It provides smooth transitions from built-indatabase functions to a completely customizedapplication.</span></p><p><span>The commands in the 4D language provide access to thestandard record management editors. For example, when you use the<code>QUERY</code> command, you are presented with the Query Editor(which can be accessed in the Design mode using the Query commandin the Records menu. You can tell the command to search forexplicitly described data. For example,<code>QUERY([People];[People]Last Name="Smith")</code> will findall the people named Smith in your database.</span></p><p><span>The 4D language is very powerful—one command oftenreplaces hundreds or even thousands of lines of code written intraditional computer languages. Surprisingly enough, with thispower comes simplicity—commands have plain English names. Forexample, to perform a query, you use the <code>QUERY</code>command; to add a new record, you use the <code>ADD RECORD</code>command.</span></p><p><span>The language is designed for you to easily accomplishalmost any task. Adding a record, sorting records, searching fordata, and similar operations are specified with simple and directcommands. But the language can also control the serial ports, readdisk documents, control sophisticated transaction processing, andmuch more.</span></p><p><span>The 4D language accomplishes even the most sophisticatedtasks with relative simplicity. Performing these tasks withoutusing the language would be unimaginable for many. Even with thelanguage’s powerful commands, some tasks can be complex anddifficult. A tool by itself does not make a task possible; the taskitself may be challenging and the tool can only ease the process.For example, a word processor makes writing a book faster andeasier, but it will not write the book for you. Using the 4Dlanguage will make the process of managing your data easier andwill allow you to approach complicated tasks withconfidence.</span></p><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="about.html_is-it-a-traditional-computer-language"></a><a aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link" href="#about.html_is-it-a-traditional-computer-language"><svg aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Is it a “Traditional” Computer Language?</span></h2><p><span>If you are familiar with traditional computer languages,this section may be of interest. If not, you may want to skipit.</span></p><p><span>The 4D language is not a traditional computer language. Itis one of the most innovative and flexible languages available on acomputer today. It is designed to work the way you do, and not theother way around.</span></p><p><span>To use traditional languages, you must do extensiveplanning. In fact, planning is one of the major steps indevelopment. 4D allows you to start using the language at any timeand in any part of your project. You may start by adding a methodto a form, then later add a few more methods. As your applicationbecomes more sophisticated, you might add a project methodcontrolled by a menu. You can use as little or as much of thelanguage as you want. It is not “all or nothing,” as is the casewith many other databases.</span></p><p><span>Traditional languages force you to define and pre-declareinterface objects in formal syntactic terms. In 4D, you simplycreate an object, such as a button, and use it. 4D automaticallymanages the object for you. For example, to use a button, you drawit on a form and name it. When the user clicks the button, thelanguage automatically notifies your methods.</span></p><p><span>Traditional languages are often rigid and inflexible,requiring commands to be entered in a very formal and restrictivestyle. The 4D language breaks with tradition, and the benefits areyours.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="docs-prevnext"><a class="docs-prev button" href="#compiler.html"><span class="arrow-prev">←</span><span>Compilation</span></a><a class="docs-next button" href="#quick-tour.html"><span>A Quick Tour</span> <span class="arrow-next">→</span></a></div></div></div><nav class="onPageNav"><ul class="toc-headings"><li><a href="#about.html_what-is-a-language">What is aLanguage?</a></li><li><a href="#about.html_why-use-a-language">Why use aLanguage?</a></li><li><a href="#about.html_taking-control-of-your-data">TakingControl of Your Data</a></li><li><a href="#about.html_is-it-a-traditional-computer-language">Isit a “Traditional” Computer Language?</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
