For oldercompatibility options, refer to the <a href="https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19R3/4D/19-R3/Compatibility-page.300-5612610.en.html">Compatibility page</a> on <strong>doc.4d.com</strong>.</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span><strong>Use legacy network layer</strong>: Starting with4D v15, 4D applications propose a new network layer, named<em>ServerNet</em>, to handle communications between 4D Server andremote 4D machines (clients). The former network layer has becomeobsolete, but it is kept to ensure compatibility with existingdatabases. Using this option, you can enable the former networklayer at any time in your 4D Server applications depending on yourneeds. <em>ServerNet</em> is used automatically for new databasesand databases converted from a v15 release or later. Note that incase of a modification, you need to restart the application for thechange to be taken into account. Any client applications that werelogged must also be restarted to be able to connect with the newnetwork layer. <strong>Note:</strong> This option can also bemanaged by programming using the <code>SET DATABASEPARAMETER</code> command.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Use standard XPath:</strong> By default thisoption is unchecked for databases converted from a 4D version priorto v18 R3, and checked for databases created with 4D v18 R3 andhigher. Starting with v18 R3, the XPath implementation in 4D hasbeen modified to be more compliant and to support more predicates.As a consequence, non-standard features of the previousimplementation no longer work. They include:</span></p><ul><li><span>initial "/" is not the root node only - using a / asfirst character in a XPath expression does not declare an absolutepath from the root node</span></li><li><span>no implicit current node - the current node has to beincluded in the XPath expression</span></li><li><span>no recursive searches in repeated structures - only thefirst element is parsed.\</span></li></ul><p><span>Although not standard, you might want to keep using thesefeatures so that your code continues to work as before -- in thiscase, just set the option <em>unchecked</em>. On the other hand, ifyour code does not rely on the non-standard implementation and ifyou want to benefit from the extended XPath features in yourdatabases (as described in the <a href="https://doc.4d.com/4dv19R/help/command/en/page864.html">DOM FindXML element</a> command), make sure the <strong>Use standardXPath</strong> option is <em>checked</em>.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Use LF for end of line on macOS:</strong> Startingwith 4D v19 R2 (and 4D v19 R3 for XML files), 4D writes text fileswith line feed (LF) as default end of line (EOL) character insteadof CR (CRLF for xml SAX) on macOS in new projects. If you want tobenefit from this new behavior on projects converted from previous4D versions, check this option.

In previous versions, text files were written with a BOMby default. Select this option if you want to enable the newbehavior in converted projects.
