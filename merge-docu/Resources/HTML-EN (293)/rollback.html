It resembles anundo function applied over several levels. It is particularlyuseful when a record has been deleted by mistake in adatabase.</span></p><p><span>This function is only available when the applicationfunctions with a data log file.</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://developer.4d.com/docs/Rx/assets/en/MSC/MSC_rollback1.png" /></span></p><blockquote><p><span>If the database is encrypted and no valid data keycorresponding to the open log file has been provided, encryptedvalues are not displayed in the <strong>Values</strong> column anda dialog requesting the passphrase or the data key is displayed ifyou click the <strong>Rollback</strong> button.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The contents and functioning of the list of operations arethe same as for the <a href="#analysis.html">Activity analysis</a>window.</span></p><p><span>To perform a rollback among the operations, select the rowafter which all operations must be cancelled. The operation of theselected row will be the last kept. If, for example, you wish tocancel a deletion, select the operation located just before it. Thedeletion operation, as well as all subsequent operations, will becancelled.</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://developer.4d.com/docs/Rx/assets/en/MSC/MSC_rollback2.png" /></span></p><p><span>Next click on the <strong>Rollback</strong> button. 4Dasks you to confirm the operation. If you click<strong>OK</strong>, the data is then restored to the exact stateit was in at the moment of the selected action.</span></p><p><span>You use the menu found at the bottom of the window toselect a data log file to be used when you apply the rollbackfunction to a database restored from an archive file. In this case,you must specify the data log file corresponding to thearchive.</span></p><p><span>Here is how the rollback function works: when the userclicks the <strong>Rollback</strong> button, 4D shuts the currentdatabase and restores the last backup of the database data. Therestored database is then opened and 4D integrates the operationsof the data log file up through to the selected operation. If thedatabase has not yet been saved, 4D starts with a blank datafile.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="docs-prevnext"><a class="docs-prev button" href="#compact.html"><span class="arrow-prev">←</span> <span>CompactPage</span></a><a class="docs-next button" href="#restore.html"><span>Restore Page</span> <span class="arrow-next">→</span></a></div></div></div><nav class="onPageNav"></nav></div></div></body></html>
