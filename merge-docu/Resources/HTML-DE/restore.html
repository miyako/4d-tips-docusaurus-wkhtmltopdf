This case doesnot require any particular operation.</span></li><li><span>If the cache contains operations, the data file is intactbut it requires integrating the current log file.</span></li><li><span>If the cache was in the process of being written, thedata file is probably damaged. The last backup must be restored andthe current log file must be integrated.</span></li></ul></li><li><p><span>The loss of application file(s). This incident can occurbecause of defective sectors on the disk containing theapplication, a virus, manipulation error, etc. The last backup mustbe restored and then the current log file must be integrated. Tofind out if an application was damaged following an incident,simply relaunch the application using 4D. The program performs aself-check and details the necessary restore operations to perform.In automatic mode, these operations are performed directly withoutany intervention on the part of the user. If a regular backupstrategy was put into place, the 4D restore tools will allow you torecover (in most cases) the application in the exact state it wasin before the incident.</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>4D can launch procedures automatically to recoverapplications following incidents. These mechanisms are managedusing two options available on the <strong>Backup/Backup &amp;Restore</strong> page of the Settings. For more information, referto the <a href="#restore.html_automatic-restore">AutomaticRestore</a> paragraph.<br />If the incident is the result of an inappropriate operationperformed on the data (deletion of a record, for example), you canattempt to repair the data file using the "rollback" function inthe log file. This function is available on the <a href="#rollback.html">Rollback</a> page of the MSC.</span></p></blockquote><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="restore.html_manually-restoring-a-backup-standard-dialog"></a><a aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link" href="#restore.html_manually-restoring-a-backup-standard-dialog"><svg aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Manually restoring a backup (standard dialog)</span></h2><p><span>You can restore the contents of an archive generated bythe backup module manually. A manual restore may be necessary, forinstance, in order to restore the full contents of an archive(project files and enclosed attached files), or for the purpose ofcarrying out searches among the archives. The manual restore canalso be performed along with the integration of the current logfile.</span></p><p><span>The manual restore of backups can be carried out eithervia the standard Open document dialog box, or via the <a href="MSC/restore">Restore</a> page of the MSC. Restoring via the MSCprovides more options and allows the archive contents to bepreviewed. On the other hand, only archives associated with theopen application can be restored.</span></p><p><span>To restore an application manually via a standard dialogbox:</span></p><ol><li><span>Choose <strong>Restore...</strong> in the 4D application<strong>File</strong> menu. It is not mandatory that an applicationproject be open. OR Execute the <code>RESTORE</code> command from a4D method. A standard Open file dialog box appears.</span></li><li><span>Select a backup file (.4bk) or a log backup file (.4bl)to be restored and click <strong>Open</strong>. A dialog boxappears, which allows you to specify the location where files willbe restored. By default, 4D restores the files in a folder named<em>Archivename</em> (no extension) located next to the archive.You can display the path:</span></li></ol><p><span><img alt="" src="https://developer.4d.com/docs/Rx/assets/en/Backup/backup07.png" /></span></p><p><span>You can also click on the <strong>[...]</strong> button tospecify a different location.</span></p><ol start="3"><li><span>Click on the <strong>Restore</strong> button. 4D extractsall backup files from the specified location. If the current logfile or a log backup file with the same number as the backup fileis stored in the same folder, 4D examines its contents. If itcontains operations not present in the data file, the program asksyou if you want to integrate these operations. Integration is doneautomatically if the <strong>Integrate last log file...</strong>option is checked (see <a href="#restore.html_automatic-restore">AutomaticRestore</a>).</span></li></ol><p><span>4.(Optional) Click <strong>OK</strong> to integrate thelog file into the restored application. If the restore andintegration were carried out correctly, 4D displays a dialog boxindicating that the operation was successful.</span></p><ol start="5"><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li></ol><p><span>The destination folder is displayed. During the restore,4D places all backup files in this folder, regardless of theposition of the original files on the disk when the backup starts.This way your files will be easier to find.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Any content related to the data file (files and<code>Settings</code> folder) are automatically restored in a<code>Data</code> subfolder within the destinationfolder.</span></p></blockquote><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="restore.html_manually-restoring-a-backup-msc"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#restore.html_manually-restoring-a-backup-msc"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Manually restoring a backup (MSC)</span></h2><p><span>You can manually restore an archive of the currentapplication using the <a href="#restore.html">Restore page</a> ofthe Maintenance and Security Center (MSC).</span></p><h2><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="restore.html_manually-integrating-the-log"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#restore.html_manually-integrating-the-log"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Manually integrating the log</span></h2><p><span>If you have not checked the option for the automaticintegration of the log file on the Restore page of the MSC (see<a href="#restore.html_successive-intergration-of-several-data-log-files">Successiveintegration of several log files</a>), a warning dialog box appearsduring the opening of the application when 4D notices that the logfile contains more operations than have been carried out in thedata file.</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://developer.4d.com/docs/Rx/assets/en/Backup/backup08.png" /></span></p><blockquote><p><span>In order for this mechanism to work, 4D must be able toaccess the log file in its current location.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>You can choose whether or not to integrate the current logfile.
