For example, files are locked when they are stored on anon-rewritable support (DVD type) or when they are copied from thistype of support. 4D can work in a transparent manner with lockeddata files, which allows, more particularly, the use of projectsstored on DVD. However, this operation runs the risk of inadvertentuse of a locked data file in which modifications will not be saved.This is why by default 4D does not allow databases with a lockeddata file to be opened.</span></p><h3><span><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="database.html_temporary-folder-location"></a><a aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link" href="#database.html_temporary-folder-location"><svg aria-hidden="true"class="hash-link-icon" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Temporary Folder Location</span></h3><p><span>This area lets you change the location of temporary filescreated while 4D is running.

Thisallows configuration of a high performance memory cache adapted tomost configurations. The size of the memory cache is thencalculated dynamically depending on set parameters. The valuesoffered by default correspond to standard 4D usage.</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Memory to be reserved for other applications andfor the system</strong>: Portion of the RAM memory to reserve forthe System and other applications. This value is increased foroptimization when other applications are running on the samemachine as 4D.</span></li><li><span><strong>Percentage of available memory used forcache</strong>: Percentage of the remaining memory allocated to thecache by default.\ To obtain the size allocated by default to thecache, simply perform the following calculation: (Physical memory-- Physical memory to be reserved) X Percentage of the memory usedfor the cache. In the adaptive mode, the size of the memory cachevaries dynamically depending on the needs of the application andthe system. You can set limits using the following twooptions:</span></li><li><span><strong>Minimum Size</strong>: Minimum amount of memorythat must be reserved for the cache. This value cannot be less than100 MB.</span></li><li><span><strong>Maximum Size</strong>: Maximum amount of memorythat can be used by the cache. This value is virtuallyunlimited.\<br />Setting limits is particularly useful for databases that aredistributed on machines for which you do not know the memoryconfiguration a priori. In this case, the limits set let youguarantee a minimum performance in all cases. The following diagramillustrates this behavior:</span></li></ul><p><span>Example for calculating cache memory: <em>Physical memoryto reserve = 256 MB Percentage of the available memory used for thecache = 50% Maximum size = 1 GB Minimum size = 128MB</em></span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://developer.4d.com/docs/Rx/assets/en/settings/memory-maximum-size.png" /></span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Calculation of adaptive cache notchecked</strong>: this mode, you set the size of the memory cachefor the database yourself. 4D then displays an entry area thatallows setting the memory cache to use as well as informationrelated to the physical memory (RAM available on the machine), thecurrent cache and cache after restart (taking your changes intoaccount).</span></p><p><span>The size of the memory cache that you enter will bereserved for the 4D database, regardless of the state of machineresources. This setting can be used in certain specificconfigurations, or when the database is designed to be used ondissimilar systems in terms of memory. In most cases, the adaptivecache offers better performance.</span></p></li><li><p><span>**Flush Cache every ... **Flush Cache every ...<strong>Flush Cache every ... Seconds/Minutes</strong>: Specifiesthe time period between each automatic saving of the data cache,i.e., its writing to disk. 4D saves the data placed in the cache atregular intervals. You can specify any time interval between 1second and 500 minutes. By default, 4D saves your data every 20seconds. The application also saves your data to disk each time youchange to another environment or exit the application. You can alsocall the <a href="https://doc.4d.com/4dv19R/help/command/en/page297.html">FLUSHCACHE</a> command to trigger the flush at any moment.</span></p><p><span>When you anticipate heavy data entry, consider setting ashort time interval between saves. In case of a power failure, youwill only lose the data entered since the previous save (if thedatabase is running without a log file).</span></p><p><span>If there is a noticeable slowing down of the database eachtime the cache is flushed, you need to adjust the frequency. Thisslowness means that a huge amount of records is being saved. Ashorter period between saves would therefore be more efficientsince each save would involve fewer records and hence befaster.</span></p><p><span>By default, 4D displays a small window when the cache isflushed.
